                <h2>1. The Oral Microbiome</h2>
                <p>The human mouth is an intricate ecosystem. Every surface—the teeth, the tongue, the cheeks—is covered in a biological film. When we talk about "oral care," we are actually talking about <strong>Microbiome Management</strong>. Not all bacteria are bad; however, when we consume high-carbohydrate diets, we select for "acidogenic" bacteria...</p>

                <h2>2. Gum Disease: The Silent Destroyer</h2>
                <p>Periodontal disease is often called a "silent" disease because it rarely causes pain until the final stages. It begins with <strong>Gingivitis</strong>, an inflammatory response to plaque. If the body's immune system cannot clear the bacteria, it begins to destroy its own bone to "get away" from the infection...</p>

                    <h4>The Systemic Link</h4>
                    <p>Recent studies in 2025 confirm that P. gingivalis (a key gum bacteria) can cross the blood-brain barrier, potentially linking oral health to cognitive decline and heart health.</p>

                <h2>3. The Chemistry of Cavities</h2>
                <p>Cavities are not just "holes." They are the result of a chemical imbalance. Your teeth are constantly in a state of <strong>Demineralization and Remineralization</strong>. When the pH in your mouth drops below 5.5, the minerals literally dissolve into your saliva...</p>

                        <h3>01. Mechanical Removal</h3>
                        <p>Brushing and flossing remain the gold standard. Electric toothbrushes with pressure sensors are recommended to avoid "Abrasion."</p>

                        <p>Fluoride and Nano-hydroxyapatite toothpastes help "plug" the microscopic holes in your enamel before they become cavities.</p>

                        <p>Dry mouth (Xerostomia) is a leading cause of tooth loss. Chewing xylitol gum can increase saliva flow by 10x.</p>

                        <p>Rinsing with water after eating acidic foods helps return the mouth to a neutral pH of 7.0 much faster.</p>

                    <h3>⭐ The Golden Rule: Time vs. Frequency</h3>
                    <p>It isn't just <em>how much</em> sugar you eat, but <em>how often</em>. Eating a whole bag of candy in 10 minutes is actually better for your teeth than eating one piece every hour for 5 hours. Why? Because the "acid attack" only lasts 20 minutes. Frequency causes constant damage; speed allows for recovery.</p>
